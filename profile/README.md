# Snijderlab

The lab of [Joost Snijder](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JSnijder) combining techniques to study viruses and their host interactions. The techniques used the most are mass spectroscopy and cryo-em microscopy. This github organisation is how we organise our code. The code is mainly centred around the tool [Stitch](https://github.com/snijderlab/stitch) which is used for antibody _de novo_ sequencing with bottom up mass spectrometry.
