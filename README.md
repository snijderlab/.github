# Snijderlab

The lab of [Joost Snijder](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JSnijder) combining techniques to study virusses and their host interactions. The techniques used the most are mass spectroscopy and cryo-em microscopy. This github organisation is how we organise our code. THe code is mainly cenetred around the tool Stitch which is used for antibody _de novo_ sequencing with bottum up mass spectrometry.
